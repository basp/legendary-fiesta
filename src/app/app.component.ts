    // With `rate` of 10 this boils down to 100 millisecods.
    // It might be a bit shorter or longer depending on browser timing.

    // First we need to find out if we under- or overshot our
    // intended interval. We expect this method to be called
    // every `interval` of time (which is a number in milliseconds)
    // so we need to see how much of the interval we have (especially
    // when we are lagging).

    // If we are running exactly on schedule then `r` should be 1.0.
    // If we are lagging then `r` will be greater than 1.0.
    // If we are running too fast (usually only happens due to tiny
    // browser scheduling variations) then `r` will be less than 1.0.
    let r = dt / interval;

    // However, if `r` is less than 1.0 we'll clamp it to 1 so we dont
    // get weird number behavior going between growth and decline.

    // 3.17 on the next frame and that is really annoying.

    // or lower tickspeed. The `tickspeed` value starts of at 1000
    // but can be dynamically adjusted by whatever the game requires. 
    // The `refspeed` value never changes but it should be equal 
    // to the `tickspeed` at the beginning of the game.

    // First we convert our scaled unit value `r` into "speed" domain.
    // If we are running exactly on time then `r` should be very close
    // to 1.0 and to normalize it we want it to be around a `refspeed` 
    // instead.

    // If tickspeed is 1000 and we are running on time then this should
    // return back into a scale unit of around 1.0.
    s = s / tickspeed;

    // Now we can finally scale our production with time and tickspeed.
    // The way we need to deal with generators depends on whether it 
    // produces energy or other generators. All generators except the first
    // one (`head`) produce generators one tier below them. The `head`
    // generators produce the actual energy.

    // of actual frame duration (`dt`).

    // technically lying to the user this leads to a much more pleasant
    // experience.
    this.state.output = grossEnergy.mul(rate).floor();

    // The rest of the generators can all be handled by just looping

    // and a booster produces generators).
